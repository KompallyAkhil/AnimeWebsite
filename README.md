# AnimeWebsite

This is my first React Project




Welcome to AnimeWebsite, a React-based website showcasing a collection of anime videos. This project utilizes a REST API with a `db.json` file to store user data and limited video content.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AnimeWebsite.git
   cd AnimeWebsite
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes, and you may see any lint errors in the console.

To store user data, run the REST API server:




Install this verison of json-server in your desktop



Copy code:


    npm install -g json-server@0.16.3


Copy code:



    json-server --watch db.json --port 8000



Features:
 
ðŸŒŸ Limited collection of anime videos.
